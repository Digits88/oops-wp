# OOPS-WP: Object Oriented Programming Structures for WordPress
This library provides a collection of interfaces and abstract classes
to support object-oriented development in WordPress.

## Installation
`composer require webdevstudios/oops-wp`

## Usage
In your project, plugin, or theme, make sure to require the Composer
autoloader, generally:

`require_once __DIR__ . 'vendor/autoload.php';`

From there, all of your classes can now extend, implement, or use
the structures provided by this library.

## Contributing
See the [contributing](Contributing.md) doc for information on
